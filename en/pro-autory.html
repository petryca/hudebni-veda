  <h1>For writers</h1>

  <h2 id="podminky">Rules of acceptance of contributions and publication of manuscripts</h2>

  <p>The editors of Hudební věda accept manuscripts in Czech, Slovak, English, German and French languages, in electronic format (*.doc, *.docx), at the email address: hudebni.veda@udu.cas.cz</p>

  <p>The journal Hudební věda publishes the following types of contributions: scholarly articles, reviews, symposium/conference reports, and further informative texts (e.g., reports on doctoral studies, habilitation and academic appointment processes, polemics, etc.).</p>

  <p>Any type of manuscript sent in to the editors must include the author´s name and contact data (email address, phone number, home or workplace address).</p>

  <p>The recommended length of a scholarly article ranges from 18,000 to 90,000 characters (i.e., between ten and 50 standard pages of text). The recommended length of reviews ranges from 5,400 to 18,000 characters (i.e., between three and ten standard pages of text).</p>

  <p>A scholarly article must be supplemented by a complete bibliography, ideally divided into a list of sources used and relevant literature. The manuscript of a scholarly article should likewise be accompanied by a summary in Czech and English, at the maximum length of 2,300 characters for each version. International contributors are welcome to supply only English-language summaries whose translation into Czech will be taken charge of by the editors. Beyond that, a scholarly article should also be accompanied by an English-language précis whose length should not exceed 1,000 characters, plus a list of key words in English.</p>

  <p>In cases where a section of the submitted text has already been previously published, the author shall make the necessary arrangements to obtain the original publisher´s authorization of its publication in Hudební věda.</p>

  <p>In cases where a manuscript includes illustrations, photographs, sheet music examples or other types of documents subject to copyright, the author shall obtain authorization of the publication of such items, upon consultation with the editors.</p>

  <p>No royalties are paid to authors on their texts published in Hudební věda.</p>


  <h2 id="citace">CITATION RULES</h2>

  <h3>Citation</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Cited text is always set in double inverted commas and using the standard font (i.e., not in italics, etc.).
    <li>Should further inverted commas appear within cited text, these shall be adjusted to single.
    <li>Any outside interventions into cited text shall be set in square brackets, including cases of deleting parts of cited text, where the space within square brackets is filled with three dots indicating the ellipsis [...].
    <li>An ellipsis shall also be indicated at the beginning of cited text where it begins within a sentence, and the cited text is not a subordinate part of a compound sentence and therefore begins with a capital letter, e.g. in positioning the cited text as a separate paragraph or, in some cases, after a colon, e.g. “[...] to be used only for a limited period!”
    <li>Where an ellipsis occurs at the end of a sentence, an additional full stop is not required.
    <li>In the first indications of names in the text proper as well as in the footnotes, first names shall always be written out in full (i.e., Bedřich Novotný, not B. Novotný).
    <li>To accentuate the second name of the author of a cited text, use small caps (N<span class="smaller">OVOTNÝ</span>) rather than uppercase letters (NOVOTNÝ).
  </ul>

  <h3>Indication of emphasis in text</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>To indicate emphasis, use exclusively italics (rather than, e.g., bold letters, underlining, capitals, etc.).</li>
  	<li>Italics shall be used in text for titles of compositions, essays, books, chapters, catalogues, artworks, poems, exhibitions etc., or to emphasize key facts or words.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Reference notes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>All reference notes are made exclusively in the form of footnotes.</li>
  	<li>Footnotes may be used in all types of texts, including reviews and reports. Footnotes are also used for reference to literature.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Pictures</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Spaces in a manuscript reserved for illustrations (including sheet music examples) shall be left empty, with only a note (Ill. 1, 2 etc.), typed in red, indicating a picture´s location.</li>
    <li>No pictorial enclosures (including sheet music examples etc.) shall be inserted within the manuscript text, but shall be delivered to the editors in the form of separate files. Each file should be named identically with the corresponding red-type indication in the  manuscript text (e.g., Ill. 1, 2 etc.).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="recenze">ASSESSMENT REVIEW PROCESS</h2>

  <p>Scholarly articles submitted for publication in Hudební věda are subjected to double-blinded reviewing, a process which usually takes four weeks, though in certain cases a reviewer may request more time for specialist assessment of a text. The editors reserve the right to reject a submitted text, for reasons related to its form or content, still prior to the initiation of the reviewing process. The purpose of a review is to provide the editors with an expert view concerning the relevance of a manuscript, as well as to supply feedback to the author.</p>

  <p>The editors´ decision and the results of the reviewing process are made known to the author by an appointed editor.</p>

  <p>Expert readers qualified to review received manuscripts of articles are chosen by the journal´s editors who may consult their choice with individual members of the editorial board specializing in the subject matter dealt with in a given article.</p>

  <p>In assessing the scholarly significance of an article, the reviewer follows the instructions specified by the “Assessment review form of the journal Hudební věda”, taking into account notably the following criteria:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>innovativeness of contributed text</li>
  	<li>its scholarly relevance</li>
  	<li>appropriateness of methodological approach</li>
  	<li>standard of work with sources and literature</li>
  	<li>linguistic, stylistic and overall formal aptitude</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Review process results</h3>

  <p>In the final assessment of a manuscript, the reviewer shall apply one of the following four options:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>recommended for publication without reservation: manuscript accepted without any changes</li>
  	<li>recommended for publication with reservations: manuscript accepted with suggested minor alterations</li>
  	<li>recommended for publication after reworking and new review assessment: manuscript accepted with suggested major alterations</li>
  	<li>not recommended for publication: manuscript rejected for specified well-founded reasons (rejected articles shall not be subjected to re-assessment)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If both review assessments are affirmative, the article is recommended for publication.</p>

  <p>If both review assessments are negative, the article´s publication is rejected under the provisions of the review assessment process.</p>

  <p>If at least one of the reviewers requires that a given article should be reworked for new assessment, the article must be reworked and then submitted for a new assessment by the same reviewer.</p>

  <p>In case of one review assessment being affirmative and the other negative, a newly appointed third reviewer shall be engaged to make a final decision.</p>

  <p>In case of the decision that an article should be reworked, the author is required to do so within the period of one month, unless another deadline has been approved by the editors.</p>

  <p>In case of continued doubts springing from the review assessment process about an article´s merit, the final decision on its publication shall be within the competence of the journal´s Editorial Board.</p>

  <p>The editors of Hudební věda, in co-ordination with the journal´s Editorial Board, have the exclusive authority to make the definitive decision on a manuscript´s publication or, alternatively, the suspension/exclusion of a given manuscript at any stage of the review assessment process, on the grounds of specified and acknowledgeable reasons. At no stage of the manuscript assessment process do authors obtain a legal claim to the publication of submitted texts.</p>

  <p>The review assessment process does not apply for the texts of reviews, symposium/conference reports and texts in the News department.</p>

  <h2 id="korektury">PROOFREADING</h2>

  <p>Upon an article´s approval for publication, the editors shall specify the issue of Hudební věda in which the article will be published. At this point, the text is passed on for language revision.</p>

  <p>The editors reserve the right to subject all texts to language revision. Any stylistic and other alterations made during that stage will be cross-checked by the author in the course of proofreading.</p>

  <p>After typesetting, contributions are sent to authors for revision in first-stage proofreading. These proofs serve only to correct minor misprints and typing errors, plus small-scale alterations of individual words, while avoiding any substantial interventions in the text, which cannot and will not be taken account by the editors. As a rule, authors proofs are expected to be completed within one week.</p>

  <p>After the publication of an article, the author shall receive an electronic copy of their text, plus two copies of the corresponding issue of Hudební věda.</p>

  <p>After the publication of a review or a symposium/conference report, the author shall receive an electronic copy of their text, plus one copy of the corresponding issue of Hudební věda.</p>
